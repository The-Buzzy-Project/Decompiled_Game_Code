***Note:*** the source code files are very large (2MB+). As such, Github will refuse to show you the contents of the files. If you wish to look at them, download them to your computer and open them in either a source code editor/viewer, or Notepad++ (like me). Note that if you use Notepad++, that it will freeze for a few seconds as it loads the file.
